xmonad-config
=============

This is a fairly straight forward Gnome-based xmonad configuration file. It has
a little trickery to get Gnome to play nicely. There is probably a better way,
but this works for me.

Installation
------------

Copy xmonad-gnome.desktop into /usr/share/xsessions. Copy xmonad-gnome into
/usr/local/bin and make sure it is executable.
